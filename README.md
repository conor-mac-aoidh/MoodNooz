An Affective Information Retrieval system for online news content.

Installation
========
This project uses the apache tomcat web server to serve jsp files. A copy of the
server is bundled with the MoodNooz application. In order to start the server
you must run:

Unix: 		./tomcat/bin/startup.bat
Windows: 	./tomcat/bin/startup.bat

Similarily to shutdown:
	
Unix: 		./tomcat/bin/shutdown.bat
Windows: 	./tomcat/bin/shutdown.bat	

The project should then be accessible by accessing http://localhost:8080 in a web browser.
